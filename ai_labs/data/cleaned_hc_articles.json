        "name": "invisibility on a local network: why we had to build a broken feature?",
        "body": "our goal at nordvpn is to provide our customers with intuitive experiences, ease of access, and the most advanced vpn features in the industry. we take pride in our continuous focus on security; however, sometimes, it comes with the cost of building a terrible feature. here's why. we recently found ourselves facing a catch-22 situation, when, due to bugs in apple's vpn api configuration, we had to choose to either sacrifice our users' experience with the app or, under certain scenarios, put a risk on their security or privacy. we believe such a choice should never occur in the first place, and we suspect that a global tech powerhouse often boasting about its focus on users' privacy understands this as well. as of yet, we are saddened by the fact that our pleas for apple to implement the necessary fixes on their operating systems continue to be acknowledged yet bafflingly ignored. being limited in what we can do on our side, we decided to offer a feature that, while aiming to offer the best possible solution security-wise, radically differs from our vision of an intuitive and smooth experience users should expect from their cybersecurity provider. stay invisible on a local network feature is our way to mitigate the tunnelcrack and tunnelvision vulnerabilities present in the vpn industry. in the case of tunnelcrack, certain routers may be configured in a way where they leak vpn traffic when using non-rfc1918 ip addresses, which is an industry-wide issue and only applies to macos and ios platforms. tunnelvision attack, in general, is a network technique that uses an operating system's dynamic host configuration protocol (dhcp) to try to route the traffic outside of the vpn's tunnel. for our macos vpn clients, the “stay invisible on a local network” feature automatically sets the appropriate api parameters and alerts users when connected to an unsafe network, mitigating the vpn traffic leak on macos. we have also built an unsecured network detection feature that will detect non-rfc1918 ip ranges, notify about possible risks, and inform users to enable “stay invisible on a local network.” on ios, the app will also inform users when they connect to an unsecured network through push notifications and in-app messages. the feature was fully released by the beginning of august 2023. in contrast, our ios vpn clients present more considerable challenges due to issues within apple's implementation of the api parameters. notably, in ios versions 14.2 and above, enabling the \"stay invisible on a local network\" feature causes internet connections to crash under certain conditions. it also prevents our vpn application from receiving client updates, leading to user internet connection crashes when updates are released. the nordvpn team hopes that this inevitably crude solution for an impossible situation will, for the time being, offer sufficient data privacy for our users and – at the same time – prompt apple to implement the necessary changes faster. what os are impacted? the tunnelcrack and tunnelvision vulnerabilities affect our macos and ios vpn clients, while our android, linux, and windows clients were immune due to implemented mitigations. nordvpn linux and windows applications can configure the os's firewall to prevent any traffic from exiting the device except through the vpn tunnel. what connectivity limitations are put in place when this feature is turned on? with the feature turned on, users cannot access other network devices, such as computers, printers, or tvs. the feature also blocks airdrop usage. what experience-breaking effects can users expect? enabling the feature in ios 16.4 and later versions can prevent the nordvpn application from receiving client updates, leading to crashes of the user's internet connection when updates are released. once users are cut off from the internet, the only solution is a device restart. how can users ensure the safety of their data in nordvpn apps? nordvpn apps do not leak traffic under any known circumstances if the stay invisible on a local network and kill switch features are enabled within the app settings menu. it’s important to note that the feature is only available to ios versions 16 and above. visual instructions on how to enable the feature on ios or how to enable this feature on macos. does the feature protect users from tunnelvision utilizing option 121, too?yes, it does. can nordvpn provide a bug-free solution without apple's input? no. unfortunately, the bugs that come with using our feature are beyond our control. apple's team has confirmed the bugs' existence and gave no clear timeline for their resolution. what else can users do to ensure a better experience using this feature? we believe that sufficiently maintained digital security is a collective effort. while we will continue searching for better solutions within our capacity, we are adamant that apple needs to address the urgent issues of significant bugs in their operating systems. we invite everyone who is not indifferent to user privacy and security issues to keep pressuring apple to fix its shortcomings in vpn api service."

        "name": "how to configure qnap 4.2.1 nas",
        "body": "this is the tutorial on how to set up your qnap nas based on ts-112p version of the disk station using 4.2.1 (20160201) firmware version. the instructions were made for connection to the us #936 server. note that if you connect to the other server, you need to name it in all the steps accordingly. connect to your qnap control panel: 1. in order to connect your qnap nas device to vpn we will need to access its control panel. the easiest way to do that is using the qfinder app provided together with qnap nas system. please run the app and wait a few moments for the qfinder to find the qnap connected to your local network. a few moments after opening the app you it should list your nas device. double click on it in the list and its control panel will be opened in your default internet browser. 2. you will now be able to log in to your qnap control panel. 3. in order to set up the vpn connection, you will need to use your administrator account. here is a tutorial on how to connect a qnap nas via openvpn: 1. start by downloading the manual .ovpn files. follow the steps below to find the manual connection configuration files: log into your nord account, and click nordvpn. scroll down to advanced settings and click set up nordvpn manually. select the openvpn configuration files tab. find the server you wish to connect to by using the search bar or by scrolling down and download it by clicking download udp or download tcp. when connecting to openvpn & ikev2 manually, you're going to need to use the username and password from the service credential tab. we will be connecting to us #936 server using udp protocol. the contents of the file are as follows: if you want to connect to a different server, please change the line remote 207.244.71.97 1194 to contain the ip address of the server you want to connect to. you also need to change the ca (text between \"\" and \"\" lines) and tls (text between \"\" and \"\" lines) keys to these of the server you want to connect to. you can find the ip addresses as well as ca and tls keys of the server you want to connect in the .ovpn configuration files that can be downloaded from https://my.nordaccount.com/dashboard/nordvpn/manual-configuration/openvpn/ (note: the .ovpn file you download from the website cannot be used instead of the file we created, as they have slightly different content)2. create a second text file with your username and password. we named the file \"nordvpnpass.txt\". enter your username in the first line and password in the second line of the file: nordvpn_usernamenordvpn_password follow the steps below to find the service credentials for manual connection setup: log into your nord account, and click nordvpn. scroll down to advanced settings and click set up nordvpn manually. select the service credentials tab, where you'll find the username and password needed to connect manually. 3. access your qnap user interface. open the file station on your qnap, navigate to the /download/ directory and create a new folder named \"vpn\" by clicking the \"+\" sign at the top of the window. you should now move the created .ovpn file (in our case, us936.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn) and nordvpnpass.txt file you have created to this directory. 4. you also need to create another text file called \"ca.crt\" that has to contain the ca certificate of the server. you can copy the same certificate as used in the .ovpn configuration file. in our case, since we are connecting to us #936 server, our ca.crt file contains this information content 5. access your qnap user interface again and go to control panel -> applications -> vpn client. 6. in the vpn client menu from the \"add\" drop down menu select \"openvpn\". 7. fill out the openvpn client settings: 7.1 enter \"us936udp\" as a profile name. you can name the profile however you like, however it is most helpful to name it for the server and settings used;7.2 type in the ip address of the server. you need to enter the same ip address as used in the \"remote\" line in step #1;7.3 enter your nordvpn credentials;7.4 change the encryption to \"highest (aes 256 bit)\";7.5 upload the ca.crt file you have created earlier;7.6 enable \"allow other network devices in the same subnet to connect to the vpn through the nas\". 8. you will now need to connect to your qnap disk station using ssh tunnel. for that you can use putty, winscp (windows) or terminal (mac os x, linux). in our cases we will be using putty client for windows (you can download putty here ).in the \"host name (or ip address)\" field enter the local ip address of your qnap (in our case, 192.168.1.60) and click \"open\". 9. enter the username and password of your qnap administrator account. 10. use this command to open the \"vpn_openvpn_client.sh\" file. vi /etc/init.d/vpn_openvpn_client.sh then press \"a\". important. copying the text to the vi editor tends to leave out some of the first characters of the copy-pasted text. you may need to manually type in the missing part of the copied text. now you need to change the beginning of this file from #!/bin/shvpn_conf=\"/etc/config/vpn.conf\"vpn_num=\"$2\"vpn_conf_s=1vpn_conf_e=10 to #!/bin/shopenvpn=/usr/sbin/openvpnclientpidfile=\"/var/run/openvpn.client.pid\"openvpn_conf=\"/share/download/vpn/us119udp.ovpn\"openvpn_conf_path=\"/etc/openvpn\"vpn_conf=\"/etc/config/vpn.conf\"vpn_num=\"$2\"vpn_client=\"openvpn_client\"\"${vpn_num}\"max_vpn_index=\"255\" once you complete editing the file press \"esc\" and enter this command \":wq\". it will save all the changes you have made to the file.also, restarting your qnap disk station will reset all changes made to this file. therefore, you will need to repeat this step after each qnap restart to connect to vpn. 11. you can now connect to the vpn using this command: openvpn --config /share/download/vpn/us936.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn 12. executing the command will not generate any message in the putty window. therefore, you need to open the openvpn.log file in the /download/vpn directory to confirm that you got connected to the vpn. the last line of the log file should be \"initialization sequence completed\""

tested by nordvpn staff – it has been shared and tested by our wonderful customers instead. in particular, nordvpn would like to thank ulmwind, an active member of the openwrt community, for their continuous assistance in providing us with up-to-date openwrt instructions. this article provides two openwrt setup guides: gui interface instructions (simplified version) cli instructions (more advanced) if any issues arise, feel free to contact our support team for further help! this is an advanced tutorial, but it also provides some simpler instructions. gui instructions in this guide, we will show you how to set up a nordvpn connection on routers using openwrt firmware via the luci web interface. access the luci interface of your openwrt router by entering its local ip address into your internet browser and logging in. the default ip address is 192.168.1.1 and the username is root.by default, there is no password set up, so you may leave this slot empty, however, when you log in you will get a message to set up a password.in order to do so, click on system > administration and you may set up a password there. once you have logged in, select the system tab and choose software. click the “update lists” button and wait for the process to finish and click “dismiss”. install the following packages by typing in their name in the “filter” field and clicking “install…”. openvpn-openssl ip-full luci-app-openvpn click “save & apply” and refresh the router page. now you should see a new tab called vpn. click on it and choose openvpn from the dropdown. now you need to download openvpn client configuration files. you can be connected to a recommended server via your nordaccount. follow the steps below to find the manual connection configuration files: log into your nord account, and click nordvpn. scroll down to advanced settings and click set up nordvpn manually. select the openvpn configuration files tab. find the server you wish to connect to by using the search bar or by scrolling down and download it by clicking download udp or download tcp. when connecting to openvpn & ikev2 manually, you're going to need to use the username and password from the service credential tab. for the purpose of this guide, we will be using the us5104.nordvpn.com server. under the “ovpn configuration file upload” section name the vpn connection in the “instance name” field (we have named it “nordvpn_us”.) after that, click on the “choose file” button, locate the downloaded server file and click “upload”. in the “openvpn instances” section, click the “edit” button next to the instance you have just created. in the lower field, enter your nordvpn service credential username and password into separate lines.usernamepassword you can find your nordvpn service credentials (service username and service password) in the nord account dashboard: follow the steps below to find the service credentials for manual connection setup: log into your nord account, and click nordvpn. scroll down to advanced settings and click set up nordvpn manually. select the service credentials tab, where you'll find the username and password needed to connect manually. now, copy the path to the credentials file that is given right above the field containing the credentials and paste it next to the “auth-user-pass” line in the “config file” section above.it should look like this: auth-user-pass /etc/openvpn/nordvpn_us.auth click on the save button at the bottom. click on the “network” tab at the top of the page and choose “interfaces“. select the “add new interface…” button and name it “nordvpntun”. click on the “protocol” dropdown menu and choose “unmanaged”. in the “interface” dropdown, enter the name “tun0” at the bottom -- custom -- field and press the enter

instructions, you should be connected using the configured connection. to check if you were successful, visit nordvpn’s homepage — the status at the top of the page should say “protected”if you wish to disconnect the vpn connection, you can click on the “stop” button next to the nordvpn option in the “vpn” > “openvpn” > “openvpn instances'' section. cli instructions if you're looking for a more advanced tutorial, follow this guide instead. to gain the benefits of a vpn on openwrt, you need a router with both openwrt firmware and an enabled openvpn client. the main page of the firmware is https://openwrt.org/. in order to start, you would need to access your router via ssh using its lan ip address. by default, the ip address is set to 192.168.1.1 and the username is root, however, the ip address may differ if you changed any of the default values. the openvpn package is not included in the firmware image by default. to install it, please run the following commands:opkg updateopkg install openvpn-opensslopkg install ip-fulladditionally, you may install the luci component of the openvpn configuration, however, it is optional. you can do so by running this command:opkg install luci-app-openvpn once you have installed the openvpn package, you can make it launch automatically whenever the router starts by running this command:/etc/init.d/openvpn enable next, you will need to download the server configuration files. follow the steps below to find the manual connection configuration files: log into your nord account, and click nordvpn. scroll down to advanced settings and click set up nordvpn manually. select the openvpn configuration files tab. find the server you wish to connect to by using the search bar or by scrolling down and download it by clicking download udp or download tcp. when connecting to openvpn & ikev2 manually, you're going to need to use the username and password from the service credential tab. for this guide, we used the server uk2054.nordvpn.com, however, you should use the server that the website suggests for you.to download a server file, choose the country where you wish to connect, click on “show available protocols”, right-click on “download config” for “openvpn tcp” or “openvpn udp” and choose “copy link address”.after that, return to your ssh session and run the following command:wget -p /etc/openvpn https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/files/ovpn_udp/servers/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpnhowever, make sure to use the link you copied for your specific server file. this command will download the configuration file to the /etc/openvpn directory for easy access.alternatively, you may download the server configuration file on a different machine and transfer it to the openwrt router using alternate methods, such as scp or sftp protocols.for older openwrt builds:you can simply download an archive here https://downloads.nordcdn.com/configs/archives/certificates/servers.zip. in the downloaded archive, you will find the corresponding files with .crt and .key extensions. the files are specific for each vpn server. the openvpn configuration for nordvpn requires you to enter your nordvpn service credential username and password every time openvpn starts. however, we will make some adjustments so the credentials would be provided automatically.first, to make the process easier, we will install the nano text editor by running the following command:opkg install nanootherwise, you may use the built-in vi text editor. for more information regarding text editors, please refer to this article: https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/user.beginner.cli.now, open the downloaded server configuration file using the nano text editor. in our case, the command would be:nano /etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpnafter that, append the word “secret” (without quotation marks) to the string “auth-user-pass”. the resulting line should be:auth-user-pass secretnow, we need to create a new file named secret, where the nordvpn service credentials will be stored. to do so, run the following command:nano /etc/openvpn/secretit will create the new file and open it using the nano text editor.in the first line of the file enter your nordvpn service username, and the second - nordvpn service password. you can find your nordvpn service credentials (service username and service password) in the nord account dashboard follow the steps below to find the service credentials for manual connection setup: log into your nord account, and click nordvpn. scroll down to advanced settings and click set up nordvpn manually. select the service credentials tab, where you'll find the username and password needed to connect manually. configure openvpn using the downloaded configuration file in one of two ways: change the file’s extension from .ovpn to .conf, which will allow openvpn to find it automatically by its extension.to do so, you can use the mv command:mv /etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn /etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.conf specify the file name in “/etc/config/openvpn” by using the following “uci” commands:uci set openvpn.nordvpn=openvpnuci set openvpn.nordvpn.enabled='1'uci set openvpn.nordvpn.config='/etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn'uci commit openvpnafter that, the file “/etc/config/openvpn” should contain the following appended strings:config openvpn 'nordvpn'option enabled '1'option config '/etc/openvpn/uk2054.nordvpn.com.udp.ovpn'you can check by running this command:tail /etc/config/openvpnyou may also change the file’s extension from .ovpn to .conf and specify it in the file “/etc/config/openvpn” - in that case, however, openvpn will start with this configuration file just once. create a new network interface by running the following commands:uci set network.nordvpntun=interfaceuci set network.nordvpntun.proto='none'uci set network.nordvpntun.ifname='tun0'uci commit networkthe file “/etc/config/network” should contain the following appended strings, if everything was done properly:config interface 'nordvpntun'option proto 'none'option ifname 'tun0'it can be checked by using the tail /etc/config/network command. create a new firewall zone and add a forwarding rule from lan to vpn by running the following commands:uci add firewall zoneuci set firewall.@zone[-1].name='vpnfirewall'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].input='reject'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].output='accept'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].forward='reject'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].masq='1'uci set firewall.@zone[-1].mtu_fix='1'uci add_list firewall.@zone[-1].network='nordvpntun'uci add firewall forwardinguci set firewall.@forwarding[-1].src='lan'uci set firewall.@forwarding[-1].dest='vpnfirewall'uci commit firewallif done correctly, the file “/etc/config/firewall” should contain the following appended strings:config zoneoption name 'vpnfirewall'option input 'reject'option output 'accept'option forward 'reject'option masq '1'option mtu_fix '1'list network 'nordvpntun'config forwardingoption src 'lan'option dest 'vpnfirewall'you can check by running tail -13 /etc/config/firewall command. this will display the last 13 lines, which should contain the aforementioned strings. now you need to configure the dns servers. the simplest approach is to use nordvpn dns for the wan interface of the router. to add nordvpn dns, run the following commands:uci set network.wan.peerdns='0'uci del network.wan.dnsuci add_list network.wan.dns='103.86.96.100'uci add_list network.wan.dns='103.86.99.100'uci commitif you receive an error message “uci: entry not found” after running the uci del network.wan.dns command, you can disregard it.the file “/etc/config/network” should contain the section ‘wan’ with the three bottom strings appended:config interface 'wan'<.>option peerdns '0'list dns '103.86.96.100'list dns '103.86.99.100'you can check by running the cat /etc/config/network command and finding the ‘wan’ interface in the output.you can also add different dns addresses, such as google’s by running these commands:uci set network.wan.peerdns='0'uci del network.wan.dnsuci add_list network.wan.dns='8.8.8.8'uci add_list network.wan.dns='8.8.4.4'uci committhe appended strings should be similar to the previous ones. (optional) to prevent traffic leakage in case the vpn tunnel disconnects, you can open the “/etc/firewall.user” file using a text editor and add the following content to it:# this file is interpreted as a shell script. # put your custom iptables rules here, and they will be executed with each firewall (re-)start # internal uci firewall chains are flushed and recreated on reload, so # put custom rules into the root chains, e.g. input or forward, or into the # special user chains, e.g. input_wan_rule or postrouting_lan_rule. if (! ip a s tun0 up) && (! iptables -c forwarding_rule -j reject); then iptables -i forwarding_rule -j reject fi additionally, you should create a file called “99-prevent-leak” in the folder “/etc/hotplug.d/iface” by running nano /etc/hotplug.d/iface/99-prevent-leak and adding the following content to the file:#!/bin/sh if [ \"$action\" = ifup ] && (ip a s tun0 up) && (iptables -c forwarding_rule -j reject); then iptables -d forwarding_rule -j reject fi if [ \"$action\" = ifdown ] && (! ip a s tun0 up) && (! iptables -c forwarding_rule -j reject); then iptables -i forwarding_rule -j reject fi in some cases, the openvpn connection can crash with a log output similar to “couldn’t resolve host…”. in this case, the vpn tunnel itself remains, however, the connection is lost. to reconnect to it automatically, first open the “/etc/rc.local” file using a text editor and add the following line:/etc/openvpn/reconnect.sh & in addition, you need to create the “reconnect.sh” file in the “/etc/openvpn” directory. it can be done by running the nano /etc/openvpn/reconnect.sh command. in the file, enter the following script contents: #!/bin/sh n=10 while sleep 50; do t=$(ping -c $n 8.8.8.8 | grep -o -e '[0-9]+ packets r' | grep -o -e '[0-9]+') if [ \"$t\" -eq 0 ]; then /etc/init.d/openvpn restart fi done when you have followed these instructions, you should be connected using the configured connection. to check if you were successful, visit nordvpn’s homepage — the status at the top of the page should say “protected.” if you wish to disconnect the vpn connection, run the following command: service openvpn stop"

(open macos launchpad and type in \"keychain access\" in a search field or in finder > applications > utilities). select the \"login\" entry (upper left corner) in the keychain window and right-click on it. click \"lock keychain \"login\". then try to unlock it. you may need to enter your mac login password after that. try to connect to our servers once again. if you are unable to make any changes in the suggested way, follow the following steps: open the terminal (finder > applications -> utilities -> terminal or cmd+space). run this single-line command to lock the keychain: security lock-keychain run this single-line command to unlock the keychain: security unlock-keychain you will be required to enter your mac user password. please note that its input will be hidden. after you enter the password, hit the return button."
